## How to setup the repository once cloned locally:
- open CMD in the folder or cd to the folder that holds the files,
- Type the following commands in order: (they are caps sensitive)
```ruby
   gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```
- Do a test build to see:
```ruby
   gradlew Build
```
- Use intellij to open the project file:
```ruby
   .project
```
- Or use eclipse to open the project: (set the project directory to be)
```ruby
    /PATH/TO/FILES/VehicleParts/eclipse/
```


## If any issues arise do not annoy me over it.. <br> <br>This project is a load of badly put together bs that should never have seen the light of day on the internet...
